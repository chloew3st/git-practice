            <h4>Learning how to troubleshoot mistakes is the whole job!</h4>
            <p>Coding is more than design and analytics, it's a journey of learning how to harness imperfection. Trouble-shooting is like 80% of the job (maybe even more, if I'm honest). Like anything worth doing, coding is challenging and rewarding once
                the hours of hard work finally pay off!
            </p>

            <h4>Teamwork is essential!</h4>
            <p>As tempting as it is to promote yourself to "god" status after learning all these incredible skills, it's important to remember that you're not in a vacuum. Life is full of "team spirit" in most activities and coding is no exception. Release
                that ego, embrace your inner humble-pie and get ready to play in the big leagues!
            </p>

            <h4>Don't beat yourself up!</h4>

            <p>Make sure to be patient with yourself in this process. Give yourself grace and be willing to step away for a minute to reassess any problems that aren't resolving themselves after repeated attempts. Sometimes all you need is a fresh perspective.
                So go take a walk and try again later!</p>
